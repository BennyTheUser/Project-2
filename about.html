                <h1>What is Water Conservation?</h1>
                <p>Water conservation is the act of preserving water through careful means as well as minimizing the quantity and quality of water. We conserve water because we need water to sustain life whether that would be for use within small communities or on a global scale. </p>

                <h1>Why do we need to conserve water?</h1>
                <p>Conserving water can save energy so that the energy can be used for filtering, heating, and pumping water which will decrease carbon traces. Conserving water will also prevent polluted water from getting into areas where nature resides so that the animals do not suffer from the pollution whenever they drink from the water. Conserving water will also save money because less water usage will mean you will be charged less from your water company.</p>
